start = root
#I was having an issue where the 2nd info element kept returning an error in my XML document. I tried using the * and the +, but neither fixed the issue. For now I found that adding a 2nd info into the schema works, but I know there has to be a more elegant soultion than this
root = element root {info, document, info}

info = element info {text}

document = element document {pg+}

pg = element pg {mixed{num, date?}}
num = attribute num {xsd:integer}
date = element date {when, text}
when = attribute when {xsd:date}

#I realize after completing this shcema that this is quite a short document, so I might add more to this if I need to.

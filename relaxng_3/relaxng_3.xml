        <pg num="1"><date when="1998-05-09">May 9, 1998</date> Played poker tonight with Scott and
            Alias from Security, and Steve from Research. Steve was the big winner, but I think he
            was cheating. That scumbag.</pg>

        <pg num="2"><date when="1998-05-09">May 10, 1998</date> One of the higher-ups assigned me to
            take care of a new creature. It looked like a skinned gorilla to me.</pg>

        <pg num="3">Scott said there'd been an accident in the basement lab. I just knew something
            like this would happen. Those bastards in Research never sleep, not even on holidays.
                <date when="1998-05-12">May 12, 1998</date> I've been wearing this damn space suit
            since yesterday. My skin's getting grimy and feels itchy all over.</pg>

        <pg num="4"><date when="1998-05-16">May 16, 1998</date> A rumor is going around that a
            researcher who tried to escape the estate last night was shot. My entire body feels hot
            and itchy and I'm sweaty all the time now. I scratched the swelling on my arm and a
            piece of rotten flesh just dropped off. What the hell's happening to me?</pg>

        <pg num="5"><date when="1998-05-19">May 19, 1998</date> fever gone but itchy today hungry
            and eat doggie food</pg>
